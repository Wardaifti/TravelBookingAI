# TravelBookingAI
This project uses a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict whether a flight booking will be completed based on user input like trip type, number of passengers, and booking lead time. The model was trained on a dataset of flight bookings and includes an interactive user input interface.
# Features

Web Scraping: Collected flight booking data from online sources for analysis and model training.

Data Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to understand data patterns and trends.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for model building, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model Building: Developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict booking completion. Achieved a reliable accuracy with hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis.

Web App Development: Built an interactive web application using HTML and Python, allowing users to input flight details and view predictions in real time.

 # Technologies Used

Programming Languages: Python, HTML

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Web Scraping Tools: BeautifulSoup, Requests

Model Deployment: Joblib for model serialization

Interactive Web App: Flask 

# Results

The model provides accurate predictions for flight booking completion based on key input features.

An interactive app allows for easy access and usability.
